# UX
The inspiration for this game was my daughter. I wanted to make a game that would have a good impact on a child's brain. As a parent I know how hard it is to keep children away from the screen, but sometimes this is inevitable. So I wanted to make a game that would be useful and fun at the same time.
I did a little research on memory games and found out that playing memory games can improve other brain functions, such as attention, concentration, and focus. Memory games give space to critical thinking and that helps children nurture their attention to detail.  
This project is intended for children from 3 - 7 years.

## Users Stories

- I want to make sure the content is applicable to children

- I want to have fun
- I want to see nice and colorful game

# Surface

# Design 
The design of this site is made in bright and cheerful colors because they make the page cheerful and the main goal of this page is fun and of course memory training. The site is intended for children from 3 to 7 years, so the site must be colorful and easy to navigate and understand.

It's one-page site with two parts.
The first part is  consists of the title, the short section "Did you know?", a button that opens the game rules, and a "Play" button that takes the user to the memory game section.
The second part is consists of the memory game section, contact form and a footer. The memory game section contains the Memory Game board under which the moves and time are located, the user can see their time and number of moves they used along the way. The user can push the reset button to reset the game and start again. 
When all the pairs are found the congratulations message pop up with final time and moves.

<img src="assets/images/readme/colors-palette.png" width="900" height="250">
</p>

- **#9df57ab5** - body background color. It fits nicely with the background image. The site looks colorful and fun.
- **#3c444c** - the main color. I choose this color because it matches nicely with the rest of the page. The color is neither too dark nor too bright.
- **#fee73bde** - color for play, how to play and reset button. The color is cheerful. That’s why I liked it because it elevates the look of the page.
- **#ff4f98**- color for Play btn. Fits nicely with yellow background. 
- **#2daaf3** - color for How to play text on the button, Reset text and background of Submit.  The color goes well with yellow and pink and gives the page a cheerful look. 
- **deeppink** - color is used for brief introduction before the board game and title of the contact form. 
- **#a9bedb** - footer background color. I liked the color because it is neither too dark nor too bright. It fits nicely with the whole page and with a submit button.


## Font 
- Arial, sans-serif - main font
- Indie Flower - for headings and buttons


## Media

**Background Image** - covering the first part of the page. It is designed in cheerful colors to make the page cheerful and fun. The picture contains animals as well as the memory game itself. I choose this image because it's children friendly and everyone loves animals.

**Memory Game** - the images contain animals, each with a background of a different color which makes game fun and colorful.

## Bugs and Issues

 - Play button was located inside the "a" tag, which threw a bug in the HTML Validator. I solved the problem by replacing the button tag with the span tag. 

- Warning: Family names containing whitespace should be quoted. If quoting is omitted, any whitespace characters before and after the name are ignored and any sequence of whitespace characters inside the name is converted to a single space.
warning was fixed by adding quotes to the Family names

- While playing a memory game I noticed that if you press the reset button you can't turn the cards over again, only after a few seconds. The problem was solved by adding the ResetBoard function to the startGame function which allows the memory board to reset

- I found an error some of the devices were not responsive, Galaxy Fold. I solved this problem by adding an extra media query - max-width 300px
